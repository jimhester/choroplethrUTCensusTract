\usage{
data(ut.tract.map)
}
\description{
The map comes from the 2010 Cartographic Boundary Shapefiles - Census Tracts 
from the US Census Bureau website.
A column named "region" was added which is a duplicate of the column GEOID. 
The GEOID is the concatenation of the 5-character county FIPS code and the 
6-character TRACTCE column.
A column named "county.fips.numeric" was added which is the numeric version
of the county FIPS code of the tract.
